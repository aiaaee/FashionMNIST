# FasionMNIST

Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. 


## DATASETS & DATALOADERS

Code for processing data samples can get messy and hard to maintain; we ideally want our dataset code to be decoupled from our model training code for better readability and modularity. PyTorch provides two data primitives: torch.utils.data.DataLoader and torch.utils.data.Dataset that allow you to use pre-loaded datasets as well as your own data. Dataset stores the samples and their corresponding labels, and DataLoader wraps an iterable around the Dataset to enable easy access to the samples.PyTorch domain libraries provide a number of pre-loaded datasets (such as FashionMNIST) that subclass torch.utils.data.Dataset and implement functions specific to the particular data. They can be used to prototype and benchmark your model. You can find them here: Image Datasets, Text Datasets, and Audio Datasets
